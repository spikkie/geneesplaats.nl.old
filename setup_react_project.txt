create-react-app --use-npm .
cat package.json 
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-serveri
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server

#creating a fairly similar environment as created with create-react-app
vi index.html    - add basic html struc

#for images etc
mkdir src/assets
mkdir src/components
mkdir src/containers

#create a React application
add index.js   // already created by create-react-app
add index.css   // already created by create-react-app
                    for some global styling

add App.js   // already created by create-react-app
                 Root component

#Create a basic React project with routing and lazy loading, just to see it is
working and it simulates a lot of functionality which you have in a normal App


#in containers folder 2 files
Users.js and Pizza.js

#in components folder 1 folder and 2 files
components/PizzaImage/PizzaImage.js
components/PizzaImage/PizzaImage.css

#fill PizzaImage.js with code to serve the pizza image html code
Each JS class is returning html (actually JSX code)


#We have two containers   Pizza and users

In App.js we will use routing to the two containers
also using HOC asyncComponent.js to lazy load the Users component

Setting up routing inside the App.js

finally update index.js mounting App.js to be rendered

------

Creating all the dependencies is the next step
1) production dependencies:  core libraries
npm install --save react react-dom react-router-dom 

#now update package.json with code so we can work with Webpack or actualz let
Webpack do the work for us
for webpack we need also webpack-cli
npm install --save-dev webpack-cli

We need a webpack configuration file for webpack to uinderstand what and how to
run

configure webpack.config.js

bable tool is used in combination of webpack
install
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-stage-2 babel-loader @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties

updated webpack.config.js for usage of babel

add .babelrc file with babel cfg 

for css we need tow different tools
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
and
npm install --save-dev postcss-loader
npm install --save-dev autoprefixer

#support for images css
npm install --save-dev  url-loader
npm install --save-dev  file-loader

One crucial package is missing
inject all css and scripts into the index.html 
for this we use html-webpack-plugin
npm install --save-dev  html-webpack-plugin
