--Django React Testing
from: https://www.valentinog.com/blog/drf/
Do not test what is already tested! So what should I test? Have you added a custom method to a Django model? Test it! Do you have a custom view? Test it! But how do I know what to test exactly?

Do yourself a favour. Install coverage:

pip install coverage

Then, every time you add some code to your application run coverage with:

coverage run --source='.' manage.py test

and generate the report:

coverage html
